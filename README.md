# Country-data
In this notebook I will use 3 unsupervised algorithms and PCA to split money between countries.

**Dataset columns:**
country: Name of the country
child_mort: Death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births
exports: Exports of goods and services per capita. Given as %age of the GDP per capita
health: Total health spending per capita. Given as %age of GDP per capita
imports: Imports of goods and services per capita. Given as %age of the GDP per capita
income: Net income per person
inflation: The measurement of the annual growth rate of the Total GDP
life_expec: The average number of years a newborn child would live if the current mortality patterns are to remain the same
total_fer: The number of children that would be born to each woman if the current age-fertility rates stay the same
gdpp: The GDP per capita. Calculated as the Total GDP divided by the total population

Target: Clustering the Countries using Unsupervised Learning algorithms to help categorizing the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.
